            <h1>Facts about Cancer</h1>
            <p>Deeply intuitive and sentimental, Cancer can be one of the most challenging zodiac signs to get to know. They are very emotional and sensitive, and care deeply about matters of the family and their home. Cancer is sympathetic and attached to people they keep close. Those born with their Sun in Cancer are very loyal and able to empathize with other people's pain and suffering.</p>
            <p> The sign of Cancer belongs to the element of Water, just like Scorpio and Pisces. Guided by emotion and their heart, they could have a hard time blending into the world around them. Being ruled by the Moon, phases of the lunar cycle deepen their internal mysteries and create fleeting emotional patterns that are beyond their control. As children, they don't have enough coping and defensive mechanisms for the outer world, and have to be approached with care and understanding, for that is what they give in return.</p>
            <p>Lack of patience or even love will manifest through mood swings later in life, and even selfishness, self-pity or manipulation. They are quick to help others, just as they are quick to avoid conflict, and rarely benefit from close combat of any kind, always choosing to hit someone stronger, bigger, or more powerful than they imagined. When at peace with their life choices, Cancer representatives will be happy and content to be surrounded by a loving family and harmony in their home.</p>
            <p>Cancer - the Brave Crab Sent to this Earth by something they believe in, only to mess with someone bigger than they are, this isn't an animal aware of their strength. Patriotism can make them endanger their own wellbeing, fighting for someone else's cause, as if others can become their higher power. The Crab knows where they're going, but this is often in a wrong direction, at least until they learn their lessons and start relying solely on themselves.</p>
            
            <h1>Cancer Constellation</h1>
            <p><b>Location:</b> Northern Hemisphere</p>
            <p><b>Visible:</b>  Best viewed in the evening during the spring months, particularly around March and April.</p>
            <p><b>Mythology:</b> Cancer is linked to the myth of the giant crab that was sent by the goddess Hera to attack Hercules during his battle with the Hydra. The crab was placed in the sky as a reward for its service.</p>
            <p><b>Stars:</b> The Cancer constellation is not home to particularly bright stars but includes the Beehive Cluster (also known as M44), which is one of the closest open clusters to Earth.</p>
           
            <h1> Love and Relationships</h1>
            <p><b>Best Matches:</b> <a href="/scorpio.html">Scorpio, </a><a href="/pisces.html">Pisces,</a><a href="/taurus.html"> Taurus, </a><a href="/virgo.html">Virgo </a></p>
            <p><b>Challenging Matches:</b> <a href="/aries.html">Aries, </a><a href="/libra.html">Libra</a></p>
            <p>Cancer is a very emotional sign, and feelings are the most important thing in their relationships. Gentle and caring, they will show their sensibility to the world without even thinking they might get hurt. For partners, they always choose a person who is able to understand them through non-verbal, silent contact, and a shared daily routine, and their affection won't last long with superficial, flaky or unreliable partners. The lack of initiative these individuals suffer from won't make it easy for them to build a sex life they wish for, if they don't find a partner who is able to make them feel calm, protected, and free to express.</p>
            <p>This is a dedicated sign, ready to make many unhealthy compromises only to keep their image of a family going, and could choose partners who are in a way selfish of abusive. Shared responsibility and a life together with their partner makes them feel secure and ready for the next step in life, no matter if it is a child, a new job, or simply a cleanup in the field of friendships and relationships that became obsolete or hurtful. In love with children, parenthood, marriage and traditional values, they can still be misguided by people they admire and trust into changing their honest approach to a modern one that doesn't fit their true personality.</p>
            <p>Compassion and understanding that a Cancer chose to send your way shouldn't ever be taken for granted, or they will show you just how bad of a match you two are in the long run.</p>
           
            <h1>Career and Money</h1>
            <p>When a job needs to get done, a Cancer will roll their sleeves up and finish it successfully. If they are left alone to work, they usually perform better than when surrounded by other people, loyal to their employer and focused on the task. They will have great careers as nurses, housekeepers, gardeners, politicians and decorators.</p>
            <p>For Cancer representatives, security and money are of great importance and stand for the real reason they work as much as they do. They easily earn money and aren't used to spending it all in one day. It is their goal to save, invest, and watch their investments grow daily. Resourceful and good at managing time and finances, this is a sign that is often in charge of all money in the household, keeping their partner or other family members under control.</p>
