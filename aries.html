            <h1>Facts about Aries</h1>
            <p>As the first sign in the zodiac, the presence of Aries always marks the beginning of something energetic and turbulent. They are continuously looking for dynamic, speed and competition, always being the first in everything - from work to social gatherings. Thanks to its ruling planet Mars and the fact it belongs to the element of Fire (just like Leo and Sagittarius), Aries is one of the most active zodiac signs. It is in their nature to take action, sometimes before they think about it.</p>
            <p> The Sun in such high dignity gives them excellent organizational skills, so you'll rarely meet an Aries who isn't capable of finishing several things at once, often before lunch break! Their challenges show when they get impatient, aggressive and vent anger pointing it to other people. Strong personalities born under this sign have a task to fight for their goals, embracing togetherness and teamwork through this incarnation.</p>
            <p>Aries rules the head and leads with the head, often literally walking head first, leaning forwards for speed and focus. Its representatives are naturally brave and rarely afraid of trial and risk. They possess youthful strength and energy, regardless of their age and quickly perform any given tasks.</p>
            <p>Aries - the Flying Ram Guided by the story of the Golden Fleece, an Aries is ready to be the hero of the day, fly away and carry many endangered, powerless people on their back. The power of the ram is carried on his back, for he is the gold itself, shiny and attractive to those ready for betrayal. The story of glory that isn't easy to carry is in these two horns, and if this animal doesn't get shorn, allowing change and giving someone a warm sweater, they won't have much to receive from the world. Each Aries has a task to share their position, power, gold, or physical strength with other people willingly, or the energy will be stopped in its natural flow, fear will take over, and the process of giving and receiving will hold balance at zero. </p>

            <p><b>Mythology:</b> Aries is linked to the Greek myth of the Golden Ram. In the myth, Phrixus and Helle rode the Golden Ram to escape their stepmother. Phrixus later sacrificed the ram to the gods, and the fleece became the prized Golden Fleece that Jason and the Argonauts sought.</p>
            <p><b>Stars:</b> The brightest star in the Aries constellation is Hamal, a giant star that is about 66 light years away from Earth.</p>

            <p>Aries love excitement in relationships. They're passionate lovers who seek adventure with their partners and value honesty above all.</p>
            <p>Aries is a fire sign with the need to take initiative when it comes to romance. When they fall in love, they will express their feelings to the person they are in love with, without even giving it a considerable thought. The compatibility of an Aries with other signs of the zodiac is very complex. Aries in love may shower their loved one with affection, sometimes even an excess of it, forgetting to check the information they get in return. They are very passionate, energetic and love adventures. An Aries is a passionate lover, sometimes even an addict to pleasures of the flesh and sexual encounters.</p>
            <h1>Career and Money</h1>
            <p>This is an area of life in which an Aries shines brightest. Their working environment is the perfect place for their ambition and creativity to show, with them fighting to be as good as possible. A natural born leader, Aries will prefer to issue orders rather than receive them. Their speed of mind and vast energy to move helps them to always be one step ahead of everyone else. All they need to do in order to succeed is follow their chosen path and not give up on professional plans guided away by emotions. When faced with a challenge, an Aries will quickly assess the situation and come to a solution. Competition does not bother them and instead encourages them to shine even brighter. They can have great careers in sports and challenging environments, and enjoy their chosen path as managers, policemen, soldiers, etc.</p>
            <p>Aries can be impulsive spenders, but their motivation to succeed means they usually find a way to bounce back financially.</p>
            <p>Even though Aries representatives can be wise and save some money for a rainy day, this is not often the case for the joy of spending it and taking risks is even greater. They live in the present and aren't that focused on the future, and this can make them irrational and hasty when it comes to financial decisions. Still, they seem to always find a way to earn money and compensate for what they have spent, in a natural flow of energy that needs to come back when invested wisely.</p>
