            <h1>Facts about Aquarius</h1>
            <p>Aquarius is the sign different from the rest of the zodiac and people born with their Sun in it feel special. This makes them eccentric and energetic in their fight for freedom, or at times shy and quiet, afraid to express their true personality. In both cases they are deep thinkers and highly intellectual people who love to fight for idealistic causes. They are able to see people without prejudice and this makes them truly special. Although they can easily adapt to the energy that surrounds them, Aquarius representatives have a deep need to have some time alone and away from everything in order to restore power.</p>
            <p> The sign of Aquarius belongs to the element of Air, finishing the story of Gemini and Libra and connecting them in a way through opposition of freedom and relationships. They will rely on their mind and spoken words most of the time, and without mental stimulation might lose interest even in the things that made their heart jump at first. They see the world as a place full of possibilities and have the need to be spontaneous, follow the moment, and live it to the fullest in an attempt not to waste any time.</p>
            <p>Uranus is the ruler of Aquarius, shoulder to shoulder with its traditional ruler – Saturn. Although Uranus has an abrupt, timid, and sometimes aggressive nature, their other ruler often grounds them enough and helps them find enough distance from other people to remain somewhat indifferent. A visionary and someone ready for changes, an Aquarius is a known thinker and someone who will shake your world once they are in it. They feel best as a part of a certain community, but might have trouble finding just the right place where they feel they belong.</p>
            <p>Aquarius – the Pretty Protégé While Ganymede might have looked thin and weak, this doesn't make character of these individuals any less powerful than it obviously is. They always have someone to carry them up, someone to show them the way towards the skies and the enlightenment they seek. Belonging to those who are in charge, their problems with authority usually come out of their relationship with other people, and not the leading structure itself. To find center, they have to be ready to dig deep. </p>
            
            <h1>Aquarius Constellation</h1>
            <p><b>Location:</b> Southern Hemisphere (also visible in parts of the Northern Hemisphere).</p>
            <p><b>Visible:</b>  Best viewed in the fall, particularly in October and November.</p>
            <p><b>Mythology:</b> Aquarius is associated with Ganymede, a young man in Greek mythology who was carried to Mount Olympus by Zeus to serve as the cupbearer to the gods.</p>
            <p><b>Stars:</b> Aquarius contains a few notable stars, such as Sadalmelik and Sadalsuud, though the constellation itself isn't exceptionally bright. It is, however, home to several famous nebulae and star clusters.</p>
            
            <h1> Love and Relationships</h1>
            <p><b>Best Matches:</b> <a href="/aries.html">Aries, </a><a href="/sagittarius.html">Sagittarius,</a><a href="/gemini.html"> Gemini, </a><a href="/libra.html">Libra</a></p>
            <p><b>Challenging Matches:</b> <a href="/taurus.html">Taurus, </a><a href="/scorpio.html">Scorpio</a></p>
            <p>Intellectual stimulation is by far the greatest aphrodisiac for an Aquarius. There's nothing that can attract them more than an interesting conversation with a person. Openness, communication, imagination and willingness to risk are the qualities that fit well in the emotional world of this zodiac sign. Their compatibility with other signs can be complex for they represent the opposition itself and have trouble relating to others if their sense of freedom is in any way endangered, or they perceive it to be. </p>
            <p>Integrity and honesty are essential for anyone who wants to stay in their life, and feelings won’t have much to do with the way they treat betrayal and those who let them down along the way. They will give independence to their partner, seeing them as equal and just as powerful as they are. Even though they can get all the freedom they desire, they could still have trouble with day to day interaction even with those they are deeply in love with.</p>
            
            <h1>Career and Money</h1>
            <p>This is a sign that brings enthusiasm, excitement, and innovations to their workplace and has a remarkable ability of exploitation of their imagination for business purposes. Their high intellect combined with their willingness to share their talents, inspires many people in their lives. They are a visionary who likes to engage in humane activities, and needs to work in a place that supports better circumstances for endangered groups of people.</p>
            <p>Finances of this zodiac sign can be spent on various risks but also held on to, and all they need to have in order to create a saving zone out of their life, is to give them something to look forward to. They are well adapted to their feel for style and are not afraid to show it, which is why their colors shining in the outer world make all the difference for their emotional state. They feel extremely good in professions such as piloting, paragliding and photography, but also make excellent programmers, ingenious mathematicians and scientists, and need to show their personality with not strict guidelines for the way to do so.</p>
