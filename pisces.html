            <h1>Facts about Pisces</h1>
            <p>Pisces are very friendly and often find themselves in company of very different people. They are selfless and always willing to help others, a very fine intent for as long as they don’t expect anything much in return. People born with their Sun in Pisces have an intuitive understanding of the life cycle and form incredible emotional relationship with other humans on the basis of natural order and senses guiding them.</p>
            <p> The sign of Pisces is a Water sign, ending the cycle of Cancer and Scorpio, being the one to disperse everything that happened in the past and change anyone’s relative view on forgiveness. They are characterized by empathy and incredible emotional capacity, but only if they keep their boundaries strong and don’t let outer emotions overwhelm them.</p>
            <p>Ruling planets of the sign of Pisces are Neptune and Jupiter, and intuition is the strongest suit of their kind. Connected to art, music, and any sort of liberal expression, every Pisces representative has a talent they need to use to feel creative and free. Tolerant and compassionate, they could do too much for other people out of good intentions, forgetting about their own wellbeing in the process.</p>
            <p>Pisces – the Loving Fish Imagine two people skinny dipping and suddenly turning into two fish swimming around each other in a crystal-clean lake. This is what the image behind Pisces should stand for, but it is more often connected to the historical and mythological background as the follower of Capricorn. Fear can drive them apart from loved ones, drive them into romance, or make them tremble feeling completely unwilling and powerless. Still, love helps them swim through the muddiest waters only to find the one their heart connects to. They are not in search for just any love you think of, but for their soulmate, someone who connects with them with an umbilical cord, ready to exchange everything they have with their Pisces partner throughout their entire shared lifetime and beyond.</p>
            
            <h1>Pisces Constellation</h1>
            <p><b>Location:</b> Northern Hemisphere</p>
            <p><b>Visible:</b>  Best viewed in the evening during winter months, particularly around February and March.</p>
            <p><b>Mythology:</b> Pisces is linked to the Greek myth of Aphrodite and Eros, who transformed into fish to escape the monster Typhon. The constellation represents their escape.</p>
            <p><b>Stars:</b> The Pisces constellation doesn’t have particularly bright stars, but it includes the star Alrescha, which is the main star in the constellation and represents the knot connecting the two fish.</p>
            
            <h1> Love and Relationships</h1>
            <p><b>Best Matches:</b> <a href="/cancer.html">Cancer, </a><a href="/scorpio.html">Scorpio,</a><a href="/taurus.html"> Taurus, </a><a href="/capricorn.html">Capricorn, </a></p>
            <p><b>Challenging Matches:</b> <a href="/gemini.html">Gemini, </a><a href="/sagittarius.html">Sagittarius</a></p>
            <p> Pisces are deeply romantic and seek a profound emotional connection in their relationships. They value empathy, understanding, and emotional depth with their partners. They thrive in relationships where there is mutual respect and a shared vision of the future. They need to feel a real connection with their partners in order to open up and find that inner sense of absolute faith in an ideal love that drives them away from any idea of change.  </p>
            <p>Short-term relationships and adventures are not typical for this zodiac sign, although they have a changeable note to them that allows them to be quite carefree when it comes to choosing a new daily fling. Once they discover the inner state of belief in someone they start sharing their life with, they become deeply loyal and honest, as if their sole purpose in life was to find the person standing in front of them and making them happy.</p>
            
            <h1>Career and Money</h1>
            <p>Pisces excel in careers that allow for creativity and empathy, such as in the arts, counseling, or social work. They may find success in fields related to spirituality or healing due to their intuitive nature. They make excellent priests, doctors, veterinarians, musicians, painters and any career that involves working in the shadows. Undercover and hidden, they could have a lot of fun playing certain parts and hiding their true identity.</p>
            <p>For the most part, Pisces don’t give money too much thought. They are usually more focused on their dreams and goals and will only try to make enough money to achieve them. Depending on the power of the dream they carry within, and the sense of purpose they were nurtured to build, each Pisces representative spends as much as needed to follow them.</p>
