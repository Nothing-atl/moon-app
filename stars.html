            <h3>Stargazing Tips</h3>
            <h4> 1. Move away from city lights</h4>
            <p> Cities are filled with light pollution caused by streetlamps, buildings and cars that drown out dimmer stars and planets in the sky.</p>
            <h4> 2. Find a clear spot where you can see as close to the horizon as possible</h4>
            <p> Make sure tall buildings and trees are not blocking your view as you stargaze. Getting higher up on mountain tops can give you a great vantage point.</p>
            <h4> 3. Check the weather forecast</h4>
            <p> Nothing ruins a night of stargazing like the sudden appearance of clouds. Also make sure to dress for the weather: nights can get chilly all year round!</p>

            <h3>Star Classification</h3>
            <p>Stars are classified by their spectral type, which reflects their temperature and the light they emit. The most widely used classification system is the Morgan–Keenan (MK) system, which groups stars into seven main categories based on their surface temperature, color, and spectral lines. These categories are: O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. Here’s a breakdown of each:</p>
            <div class="star-class-types">
            <div class="types">
            <h4> O-Type Stars</h4>
            <p><b> Temperature: </b> > 30,000 K <br>
                <b>Color: </b> Blue<br>
                <b>Characteristics: </b> O-type stars are extremely hot, bright, and massive. They emit large amounts of ultraviolet light and have short lifespans due to their high energy output. These stars are rare but very influential in shaping the surrounding interstellar medium.<br>
                <b>Examples: </b> Zeta Puppis, Theta1 Orionis C</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="types">
            <h4> B-Type Stars</h4>
            <p><b> Temperature: </b>  10,000 – 30,000 K <br>
                <b>Color: </b> Blue-White<br>
                <b>Characteristics: </b> B-type stars are slightly cooler than O-types but still very bright and luminous. They have strong hydrogen spectral lines and tend to form in large clusters. These stars also have short lives, typically ending in supernovae.<br>
                <b>Examples: </b> Rigel, Spica</p>
                
            </div>    
            <div class="types">
                <h4> A-Type Stars</h4>
                <p><b> Temperature: </b>  7,500 – 10,000 K <br>
                    <b>Color: </b> White<br>
                    <b>Characteristics: </b> A-type stars are white in color and have strong hydrogen lines in their spectra. They are among the more common stars visible to the naked eye and are often seen in the main sequence stage.<br>
                    <b>Examples: </b> Sirius, Vega</p>
                    
            </div>
            <div class="types">
                <h4> F-Type Stars</h4>
                <p><b> Temperature: </b> 6,000 – 7,500 K <br>
                    <b>Color: </b> Yellow-White <br>
                    <b>Characteristics: </b>  F-type stars have moderate temperatures and show metal lines (like calcium) in their spectra. These stars are stable and have relatively long lifespans compared to the hotter types.<br>
                    <b>Examples: </b> Procyon, Canopus </p>
                    
                </div>
            <div class="types">
                <h4> G-Type Stars</h4>
                <p><b> Temperature: </b> 5,200 – 6,000 K <br>
                    <b>Color: </b> Yellow<br>
                    <b>Characteristics: </b> G-type stars, like our Sun, are moderate in size and temperature. They emit a yellowish light and are rich in elements heavier than helium. G-type stars often live long enough to allow for the development of planetary systems.<br>
                    <b>Examples: </b> The Sun, Alpha Centauri A</p>
                    
                </div>
                <div class="types">
            <h4> K-Type Stars</h4>
            <p><b> Temperature: </b>3,700 – 5,200 K <br>
                <b>Color: </b> Orange<br>
                <b>Characteristics: </b> K-type stars are cooler and more orange than G-type stars. They have long lifespans and are more common in the universe. These stars are ideal for potentially hosting planets with life due to their stability and longevity.<br>
                <b>Examples: </b> Arcturus, Aldebaran</p>
                
            </div>

                    <b>Color: </b> Red<br>
                    <b>Characteristics: </b> M-type stars, also known as red dwarfs, are the coolest and most common stars in the universe. Despite their dimness, they have extremely long lifespans, often lasting trillions of years. Many planets have been found orbiting M-type stars.                    <br>

            <h3> Famous Stars</h3>
            <p>Throughout history, certain stars have held special significance in navigation, mythology, and astronomy. Here is a list of some of the most famous stars and their importance:</p>
           <div class="fstars">
            <div class="stars">
                <h4> Polaris (North Star)</h4>
                <p> <b> Constellation:</b> Ursa Minor <br>
                    <b> Significance: </b> Polaris is perhaps the most famous navigational star, used for centuries to find true north. It is almost directly aligned with Earth's rotational axis, making it appear nearly stationary in the sky, while other stars rotate around it. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="stars">
                <h4> Sirius (Dog Star)</h4>
                <p> <b> Constellation:</b> Canis Major <br>
                    <b> Significance: </b> Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky and was historically significant to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, who used its rising to predict the flooding of the Nile. Its name comes from the Greek word for "glowing." </p>
            </div>

            <div class="stars">
                <h4> Betelgeuse</h4>
                <p> <b> Constellation:</b> Orion <br>
                    <b> Significance: </b> Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star and one of the largest visible stars in the sky. It marks the shoulder of Orion the Hunter. Due to its size and variability, it is expected to go supernova within the next 100,000 years. </p>
